What is a remote repository?
	Remote repositories are versions of your project 
	that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere.
	In our case it is GitHub mostly.
	
What is push?
	The push term refers to upload local repository content to a remote repository. 
	Pushing is an act of transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repository. 
	Pushing is capable of overwriting changes; caution should be taken when pushing. 
	Moreover, we can say the push updates the remote refs with local refs.
	
What is pull?
	The git pull command is used to fetch and download 
	content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository 
	to match that content. Merging remote upstream changes into your local 
	repository is a common task in Git-based collaboration work flows.
	
->to connect the local with remote repository on github/hoster we do:

	git remote add <name_with_which_you_would_call_remote_repository_in_git> <url_of_remote_repository>
	
	generally the name we keep for the remote repository is "origin"
	
->to display the name of the remote the command is

	git remote
	
->to display the url of the repositories where we push and pull (both urls can be different as
repository to push and repository to pull can be different but in most cases both will be same):

	git remote -v
	
->to push changes to remote repository we do:

	git push -u origin master
	
	origin is the name we will be frequently using for the remote repository url

->to pull from the remote repository we do:

	git pull <url_of_the_repository>             //the url of the repository can be found in the search bar or in drop down box of code button(in green color)
